I've built the video library app, It is a MERN-based Web app inspired by Youtube

I always try to develop better, more complex & bigger projects than my previous ones, In this App, 

I've started building <b>Front-End</b> which contains routes & components like sign-in, signup, trending, subscribed, videos, and recommendations with React.js, Redux, JavaScript & Styled Components

For the <b>BackEnd</b>, I've built the Modals (user, video, comment), Server-routes & RestAPI with Node.js and MongoDB, and tested the Server-request of RestAPI with Insomnia.

For the <b>Storage</b>, I'm using Firebase-storage which will help to store large-size videos and add their URL to MongoDB which plays a crucial role in video performance & speed
